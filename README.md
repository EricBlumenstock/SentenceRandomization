Background Information
=========================
This is a pet project I did for my brother when he mentioned how cool it would be to dynamically create English assignments or random sentences to discuss in class. What this does is allows a user to enter in multiple sentences with zero to many placeholders and inserts a random word into that placeholder. When a different user clicks generate on a separate page it would create a random sentence. The primary feature my brother was looking for in this project though was the ability to save lists of sentence fragments and placeholder words as files and unique URLs. This way he could direct his students to a particular URL for a specific assignment. This is still a work in progress, as my brother requested a few more features such as limiting the randomization in certain ways. I've also attached two screenshots to demonstrate what it looks like.

What language(s) were used?
